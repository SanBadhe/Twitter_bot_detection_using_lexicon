# Twitter_bot_detection_using_lexicon
We are trying to build twitter bot detection model using sentiment analysis.
Currently model worked on account level bot detection using adaboost, DecisionTree and Logistic Regression Classifier.
But we are in the process of tweet level detection using recurrent neural network and LSTM.
